		<h2>Open Source Educational Content</h2>
		<p>Great educational content is easier to access on the internet, and we are here to bring it to the offline community. For the first time, all the educational content that Kolibri offers for curation is licensed to be freely distributed and remixed for your own curricular needs.</p>

		<h2>Learn, Online and Offline</h2>
		<p>Learners can engage with high-quality educational material from the internet, even when internet connection is unreliable. Kolibri will enable educators to integrate and distribute their unique educational content through an offline server that is accessible through a local network.</p>

		<h2><a href= "{% url 'ka_lite' %}">KA Lite</a> </h2>
		<p>In the past, we have deployed our <a href="{% url 'ka_lite' %}" target="_blank">KA Lite</a> software to hundreds of communities that lack connectivity, giving them access to high quality educational content through low-cost hardware. With Kolibri, we aim to further enhance this offline learning experience by providing teachers and organizations with the power and flexibility to curate and share original content that best fits their students' needs.

		<h1>Syncing and Sharing</h1>
		<p>Content and data is stored on the local server and synced with an online repository once it reaches an internet connection. Here are a few ways that teachers and learners can share data, content, and software updates -- all offline.</p>

		<h2>Peer to Peer</h2>
		<p>With the “device discovery” interface, devices can find and directly connect with each other over a local wi-fi network, allowing for easy content sharing and data updates.</p>

		<h2>Sneakernet</h2>
		<p>Kolibri is also designed for easy transfer of content, data, and updates via the “sneakernet.” Users can use USB memory sticks to sync and share content, data, and updates through an easy-to-use web interface.</p>

		<h3>Content Vectorization</h3>
		<p>Downloading content is easy and fast. We found a way to compress huge libraries of content to fit on tiny USB hard drives, which is done by converting only the necessary parts of content items to scalable components.</p>
