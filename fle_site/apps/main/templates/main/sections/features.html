			<h3>Quizzes and Exercises</h3>

			<h3>Progress Tracker</h3>
			<p>Learners can view their progress, and receive recommendations about what lessons or exercises to do next. Teachers or mentors can also track students’ progress by viewing “Coach Reports”, allowing them to see which students need extra help and identify where they can most effectively intervene to help students overcome learning barriers.</p>

			<h3>Learn from Feedback</h3>
			<p>Learners can provide feedback by rating and commenting on the content they view. Kolibri’s content recommendation system then highlights the most useful and relevant content on a learner’s dashboard. These ratings and feedback can also be synced to the online server to help content curators improve existing content.</p>
