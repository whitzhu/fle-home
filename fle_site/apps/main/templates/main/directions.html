            <h1>Directions to the Learning Equality Offices</h1>
            <p>
                The Learning Equality offices are located in the Qualcomm Institute Innovation Space, in Richard C. Atkinson Hall, on the UCSD Campus.
            </p>
            <p>
                Visitors to the UCSD campus are allowed to park in Visitor spaces after purchasing a parking permit from one of the automated machines found at each parking lot ($1 / 45 minutes, $8 for a full-day). Visitor spaces are marked with a white "V". You can read more about parking at UCSD on the <a href="http://blink.ucsd.edu/facilities/transportation/visitor/">Parking &amp; Transportation Website</a>.
            <p>
                The most convenient Visitor spots near our offices are on Equality Lane, in Warren College, across from Richard C. Atkinson Hall. A red pin on the map below marks Equality Lane.

                If those spaces are full, you should be able to find space in Hopkins Parking Structure which is just up the hill and marked with a red pin in the embedded map below.
