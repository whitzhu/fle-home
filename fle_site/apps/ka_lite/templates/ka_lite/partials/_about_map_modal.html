            When <a href="{% url "ka_lite" %}" target="_blank">KA Lite</a> was first released in December of 2012, we tried to track known installations and budding partnerships on a map on the wall of our office.
          </p>
          <p>
            <img src="{% static 'img/ka-lite/original_map.jpg' %}" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail" alt="The original map used by the Learning Equality team to track KA Lite installations manually.">
          </p>
          <p>
            As the trickle of installations turned into a flood, our wall map quickly became outdated. Over the past year and half, we've been in touch with hundreds of individuals and organizations using KA Lite, and we decided that it was time for more of these stories to be shared with the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            The red pins on the map are individuals or organizations who have downloaded KA Lite, installed it, and registered with our central server. The green houses represent individuals or organizations with whom we have been in contact (by email, phone, or in-person meetings), who have been using KA Lite to enhance educational opportunities for the communities that they serve. The stories and photos included here were generously supplied by these incredible people.
